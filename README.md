# CVue -- Resume Builder

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-brightgreen)

This project is a modern, web-based resume builder designed specifically for software developers, built using Vue 3 and TypeScript. It originated from the need for a tailored solution to create professional resumes that reflect the unique demands of the software development field. Featuring real-time resume building with a live preview, the application allows users to seamlessly craft resumes across multiple structured sections, including an introduction, skills, education, professional experiences (one page per experience), and a miscellaneous page for additional information.

Primarily developed as a personal tool, this project also serves as a showcase of my expertise with the Vue tech stack, emphasizing dynamic form handling, component-driven architecture, and modern development practices. The application will be deployed publicly to help others craft their resumes and as a testament to continuous improvement in my software engineering journey.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
